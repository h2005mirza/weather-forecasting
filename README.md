# weather-forecasting
This is a  Python program used for weather forecasting purposes 
1. In this program, we use the OpenWeatherMap API to forecast. We have declared start and end date variables by which the user can enter the date he or she desires and  view the forecast of those specific city dates.
This is an exciting simple and fun exercise and also for educational purposes.
And I am excited that I can now use different APIs to develop different  types of programs.
