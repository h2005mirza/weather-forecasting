# weather-forecasting
This is a  Python program used for weather forecasting purposes 
1. In the second program, we use the same API for the same purpose but this time with a little twist. We have declared start and end date variables by which the user can enter the date he or she desires and can view the forecast of those specific city dates.
This is an exciting simple and fun exercise and also for educational purposes.
And I am excited that as of now, I can use different APIs to develop different types of programs.
