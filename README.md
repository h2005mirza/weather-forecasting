# weather-forecasting
These are 2 Python programs used for weather forecasting purposes 
1. The first code uses the OpenWeatherMap API for forecasting weather over 3 hour duration. It displays the weather of the city
inputted by the user. We use the urllib and json Python libraries in this.
2. In the second program, we use the same API for the same purpose but this time with a little twist. We have declared start and end date variables by which the user can enter the date he or she desires and can view the forecast of those specific dates of the city.
This is an exciting simple and fun exercise and also for educational purposes.
And I am excited that as of now, I can use different API's to develop different types of programs.
